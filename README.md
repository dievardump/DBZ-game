DBZ-game
========

Client side 
Attempt to port the Picwin Game (http://www.mircscripts.org/comments.php?cid=2483) by Epsilon 


Two versions available :

- Only html+css : http://dievardump.github.com/DBZ-game
  Code : First attempt, not really structured or beautiful
  Game : This version is the more elaborate since I developed it at first.
  It handles all movements (left/right/up/upleft/upright) and actions (punch = a, kick = z, highkick = e, fireball = q, block = s)
  
- Only canvas : http://dievardump.github.com/DBZ-game/index-canvas.html
  Code : is stronger and cleaner
  Game : Just handle left/right actions. Will change as soon as i have time to develop on it.
